components why :
reusable building block
related codes lives together
separation of concerns
declarative :
component composition:
children props vs attribute props : single vs multiple
state:
conditional rendering
dynamic style
wrapper component(reusable)
derived state => lifting state up => multiple states up
nested list
array and object states
component functions vs normal functions
