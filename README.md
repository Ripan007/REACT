reusable building blocks => small building  blocks ,  compose ,reuse
related code lives together => stored together
separation of concerns => different , simplifies

key important things :
components : reusable building blocks which are used to build  the  overall app  ui
props : component attribute  (input data)  used to configure components
jsx : js syntax extension to describe html in javascript
state : react-managed data which  when changed cause react to re-execute the related  component  functions
